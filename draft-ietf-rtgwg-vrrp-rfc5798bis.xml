        This document defines version 3 of the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)
        for IPv4 and IPv6. It is based on VRRP (version 2) for IPv4 that is defined in
        RFC 3768 and in "Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol for IPv6",
        and obsoletes the previous
        specification of this version documented in RFC 5798.  VRRP specifies an
        election protocol that dynamically assigns responsibility for a
        Virtual Router to one of the VRRP Routers on a LAN.  The VRRP Router
        controlling the IPv4 or IPv6 address(es) associated with a Virtual
        Router is called the Active Router, and it forwards packets sent to these
        IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  Active Routers are configured with
        virtual IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, and Backup Routers infer the
        address family of the virtual addresses being advertised based on the
        IP protocol version.  Within a VRRP Router, the Virtual Routers in
        each of the IPv4 and IPv6 address families are independent of one another
        and always treated as separate Virtual Router instances.
        The election process provides dynamic
        failover in the forwarding responsibility should the Active Router become
        unavailable.  For IPv4, the advantage gained from using VRRP is a
        higher-availability default path without requiring configuration of
        dynamic routing or router discovery protocols on every end-host.  For
        IPv6, the advantage gained from using VRRP for IPv6 is a quicker
        switchover to Backup Routers than can be obtained with standard IPv6
        Neighbor Discovery mechanisms.
      </t>
      <t>
	The VRRP terminology has been updated to conform to inclusive language
        guidelines for IETF technologies.

        <name>A Note on Terminology</name>
        <t>
	  This document discusses both IPv4 and IPv6 operations, and with
          respect to the VRRP protocol, many of the descriptions and procedures
          are common.  In this document, it would be less verbose to be able to
          refer to "IP" to mean either "IPv4 or IPv6".  However, historically,
          the term "IP" usually refers to IPv4.  For this reason, in this
          specification, the term "IPvX" (where X is 4 or 6) is introduced to
          mean either "IPv4" or "IPv6".  In this text, where the IP version
          matters, the appropriate term is used, and the use of the term "IP" is
          avoided.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sect-1.3">
        <name>IPv4</name>
        <t>
	  There are a number of methods that an IPv4 end-host can use to
          determine its first-hop router for a particular IPv4 destination.
          These include running (or snooping) a dynamic routing protocol such
          as Routing Information Protocol (RIP) <xref target="RFC2453"/> or OSPF version 2
	  <xref target="RFC2328"/>, running an ICMP router discovery client
        <xref target="RFC1256"/>, or using a statically configured default route.</t>
        <t>
	  Running a dynamic routing protocol on every end-host may
          not be feasible for a number of reasons, including administrative
          overhead, processing overhead, security issues, or the lack of an
          implementation for a particular platform.  Neighbor or router discovery
          protocols may require active participation by all hosts on a network,
          requiring large timer values to reduce protocol overhead associated
          with the protocol packet processing for each host.  This can result in
          a significant delay in the detection of an unreachable router and,
          such a delay may introduce unacceptably long periods of unreachability for the
          default route.
        </t>
        <t>
	  The use of a statically configured default route is quite popular since it
          minimizes configuration and processing overhead on the end-host and
          is supported by virtually every IPv4 implementation.  This mode of
          operation is likely to persist as dynamic host configuration
          protocols <xref target="RFC2131"/> are deployed, which typically provide
          configuration for an end-host IPv4 address and default gateway.
          However, this creates a single point of failure.  Loss of the default
          router results in a catastrophic event, isolating all end-hosts that
        are unable to detect an available alternate path.</t>
        <t>
	  The Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) is designed to
          eliminate the single point of failure inherent in a network utilizing
          static default routing.  VRRP specifies an election protocol that
          dynamically assigns responsibility for a Virtual Router to one of the
          VRRP Routers on a LAN.  The VRRP Router controlling the IPv4
          address(es) associated with a Virtual Router is called the Active Router and
          forwards packets sent to these IPv4 addresses.  The election process
          provides dynamic failover of the forwarding responsibility should the
          Active Router become unavailable.  Any of the Virtual Router's IPv4
          addresses on a LAN can then be used as the default first hop
	  router by end-hosts.  The advantage gained from using VRRP is a
          higher availability default path without requiring configuration of
          dynamic routing or a router discovery protocol on every end-host.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sect-1.4">
        <name>IPv6</name>
        <t>
	  IPv6 hosts on a LAN will usually learn about one or more default
          routers by receiving Router Advertisements sent using the IPv6
          Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol <xref target="RFC4861"/>.
          The Router Advertisements are periodically multicast
          at a rate such that the hosts will normally take more
          than 10 seconds to learn the default routers on a LAN.
          They are not sent frequently enough to rely on the absence
          of the Router Advertisement to detect router failures.
        </t>
        <t>
	  The ND protocol includes a mechanism called Neighbor
          Unreachability Detection to detect the failure of a neighbor node
          (router or host) or the forwarding path to a neighbor.  This is done
          by sending unicast ND Neighbor Solicitation messages to the neighbor
          node.  To reduce the overhead of sending Neighbor Solicitations, they
          are only sent to neighbors to which the node is actively sending
          traffic and only after there has been no positive indication that the
          router is up for a period of time.  Using the default parameters in
          ND, it can take a host more than 10 seconds to learn that a router is
          unreachable before it will switch to another default router.  This
          delay would be very noticeable to users and cause some transport
          protocol implementations to time out.
        </t>
        <t>
	  While the ND unreachability detection could be made quicker by
          configuring the timer intervals to be more aggressive (note that the current
          lower limit for this is 5 seconds), this would have the downside of
          significantly increasing the overhead of ND traffic, especially when
          there are many hosts all trying to determine the reachability of one
          or more routers.
        </t>
        <t>
	  The Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol for IPv6 provides a much
          faster switchover to an alternate default router than can be obtained
          using standard ND procedures.  Using VRRP, a Backup Router can take
          over for a failed default router in around three seconds (using VRRP
          default parameters).  This is done without any interaction with the
          hosts and a minimum amount of VRRP traffic.

	  A simple model of Active Router election among a set of redundant routers is
          to treat each router with equal preference and claim victory after
          converging to any router as Active Router.  However, there are likely to be
          many environments where there is a distinct preference (or range of
          preferences) among the set of redundant routers.  For example, this
          preference may be based upon access link cost or speed, router
          performance or reliability, or other policy considerations.  The
          protocol should allow the expression of this relative path preference
          in an intuitive manner and guarantee Active Router convergence to the most
          preferred Virtual Router currently available.
        </t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sect-2.3">
	<name>Minimization of Unnecessary Service Disruptions</name>
	<t>
	  Once Active Router election has been performed, any unnecessary transition
          between Active and Backup Routers can result in a disruption in
          service.  The protocol should ensure that, after Active Router election, no
          state transition is triggered by any Backup Router of equal or lower
          preference as long as the Active Router continues to function properly.
        </t>
	<t>
	  Some environments may find it beneficial to avoid the state
          transition triggered when a router that is preferred over the current

	<name>Efficient Operation over Extended LANs</name>

	  Sending IPvX packets, i.e., sending either IPv4 or IPv6, on a
          multiaccess LAN requires mapping from an IPvX address to a MAC
          address.  The use of the Virtual Router MAC address in an extended
          LAN employing learning bridges can have a significant effect on the
          bandwidth overhead of packets sent to the Virtual Router.  If the
          Virtual Router MAC address is never used as the source address in a
          link-level frame, then the MAC address location is never learned,
          resulting in flooding of all packets sent to the Virtual Router.  To
          improve the efficiency in this environment, the protocol should do the
          following:
        </t>
        <ol spacing="normal" type="1">
          <li>
            Use the Virtual Router MAC address as the source in a packet sent
            by the Active Router to trigger MAC learning.
          </li>
          <li>
            Trigger a message immediately after transitioning to the
            Active Router to update MAC learning.
          </li>
          <li>
            Trigger periodic messages from the Active Router to
            maintain the MAC address cache.

	<name>Sub-Second Operation for IPv4 and IPv6</name>
	<t>
	  Sub-second detection of Active Router failure is needed in both
          IPv4 and IPv6 environments.  Earlier work proposed that sub-second
          operation was for IPv6 and this specification leverages that earlier
          approach for both IPv4 and IPv6.

	  One possible problematic scenario may occur when using a small
          Advertisement_Interval (refer to <xref target="sect-6.1"/>) is
          when a VRRP Router is generating more packets than it can transmit, and a queue
          builds up on the VRRP Router.  When this occurs, it is possible that packets being
          transmitted onto the VRRP-protected LAN could see larger queueing
          delay than the smallest Advertisement_Interval.  In this case,
          the Active_Down_Interval (refer to <xref target="sect-6.1"/>) may be small
          enough that normal queuing
          delays might cause a Backup Router to conclude that the Active Router is down,
          and, hence, promote itself to Active Router.  Very shortly afterwards, the
          delayed VRRP packets from the original Active Router cause a switch back to Backup
          Router.  Furthermore, this process can repeat many times per second,
          causing a significant disruption of traffic.  To mitigate this problem,
          priority forwarding of VRRP packets should be considered.  The Active
          Router SHOULD observe that this situation is occurring and log the problem.

      <name>VRRP Overview</name>
      <t>
	VRRP specifies an election protocol to provide the Virtual Router
        function described earlier.  All protocol messaging is performed
        using either IPv4 or IPv6 multicast datagrams. Thus, the protocol can
        operate over a variety of multiaccess LAN technologies supporting
        IPvX multicast.  Each link of a VRRP Virtual Router has a single
        well-known MAC address allocated to it.  This document currently only
        details the mapping to networks using an IEEE 802 48-bit MAC
        address.  The Virtual Router MAC address is used as the source in all
        periodic VRRP messages sent by the Active Router to enable MAC
      learning by layer-2 bridges on an extended LAN.</t>
      <t>
	A Virtual Router is defined by its Virtual Router Identifier (VRID)
        and a set of either IPv4 or IPv6 address(es).  A VRRP Router may
        associate a Virtual Router with its real address on an interface.
        The scope of each Virtual Router is restricted to a single LAN.  A
        VRRP Router may be configured with additional Virtual Router mappings
        and priority for Virtual Routers it is willing to back up.  The
        mapping between the VRID and its IPvX address(es) must be coordinated
        among all VRRP Routers on a LAN.
      </t>
      <t>
	There is no restriction against reusing a VRID with a different
        address mapping on different LANs, nor is there a restriction against
        using the same VRID number for a set of IPv4 addresses and a set of
        IPv6 addresses. However, these are two different Virtual Routers.
      </t>
      <t>
	To minimize network traffic, only the Active Router for each Virtual Router
        sends periodic VRRP Advertisement messages.  A Backup Router will not
        attempt to preempt the Active Router unless the Backup Router
        has a higher priority.  This
        eliminates service disruption unless a more preferred path becomes
        available.  It's also possible to administratively prohibit Active Router
        preemption attempts.  The only exception is that a VRRP Router will
        always become the Active Router for any Virtual Router associated with
        address(es) it owns.  If the Active Router becomes unavailable, then the
        highest-priority Backup Router will transition to Active Router
        after a short delay, providing a controlled transition of Virtual Router
        responsibility with minimal service interruption.
      </t>
      <t>
	The VRRP protocol design provides rapid transition from Backup Router to
        Active Router to minimize service interruption and incorporates
        optimizations that reduce protocol complexity while guaranteeing
        controlled Active Router transition for typical operational scenarios.  These
        optimizations result in an election protocol with minimal runtime
        state requirements, minimal active protocol states, and a single
        message type and sender.  The typical operational scenarios are
        defined to be two redundant routers and/or distinct path preferences
        for each router.  A side effect when these assumptions are violated,
        i.e., more than two redundant paths with equal preference, is
        that duplicate packets may be forwarded for a brief period during
        Active Router election.  However, the typical scenario assumptions are
        likely to cover the vast majority of deployments, loss of the Active
        Router is infrequent, and the expected duration for Active Router election
        convergence is quite small (&lt; 4 seconds when using the default
        Advertisement_Interval and configurable to &lt; 1/25 second).  Thus,
        the VRRP optimizations represent significant simplifications in
        the protocol design while incurring an insignificant probability of
        brief network disruption.

                 ]]></artwork>
        <t>
          In the IPv4 case, i.e., IPvX is IPv4 everywhere in the figure,
          each router is permanently assigned an IPv4 address on the LAN
          interface (Router-1 is assigned IPv4 A and Router-2 is assigned IPv4 B), and
          each host installs a static default route through one of the routers
          (in this example, they all use Router-1's IPv4 A).
        </t>
        <t>
          In the IPv6 case, i.e., IPvX is IPv6 everywhere in the figure, each router has its own
          Link-Local IPv6 address on the LAN interface, and a link-local
          IPv6 address per VRID that is shared with the other routers that serve the same VRID.
          Each host learns a default route from Router
          Advertisements through one of the routers (in this example, they all
          use Router-1's IPv6 Link-Local A).
        </t>
        <t>
          In an IPv4 VRRP environment, each router supports reception and transmission for
          the exact same IPv4 address.  Router-1 is said to be the IPv4
          address owner of IPv4 A, and Router-2 is the IPv4 address owner of
          IPv4 B.  A Virtual Router is then defined by associating a unique
          identifier (the VRID) with the address owned by Router-1.
        </t>
        <t>
          In an IPv6 VRRP environment, each router will support transmission and
          reception for the IPv6 addresses associated with the VRID.
          Router-1 is said to be the IPv6 address owner
          of IPv6 A, and Router-2 is the IPv6 address owner of IPv6 B.  A Virtual
          Router is then defined by associating a unique identifier (the
          VRID) with the address owned by Router-1.
        </t>
        <t>
          Finally, in both the IPv4 and IPv6 cases, the VRRP protocol manages
          Virtual Router failover to a Backup Router.
        </t>
        <t>
          The IPvX example above shows a Virtual Router configured to cover the
          IPv4 address owned by Router-1 (VRID=1, IPvX_Address=A).  When VRRP is
          enabled on Router-1 for VRID=1, it will assert itself as Active Router, with
          priority = 255, since it is the IPvX address owner for the Virtual
          Router IPvX address.  When VRRP is enabled on Router-2 for VRID=1, it will
          transition to Backup Router, with priority = 100 (the default priority is
          100), since it is not the IPvX address owner.  If Router-1 should fail,
          then the VRRP protocol will transition Router-2 to Active Router, temporarily
          taking over forwarding responsibility for IPvX A to provide
          uninterrupted service to the hosts.
        </t>
        <t>
          Note that in both cases in this example, IPvX B is not backed up and it
          is only used by Router-2 as its interface address.  In order to back up
          IPvX B, a second Virtual Router must be configured.  This is shown in
          the next section.

            the higher-priority Active Router with a slower rate.  When this happens, it
            is temporary, once the lower-priority node does hear from the higher-priority

          <t>
            When a Backup VRRP Router has become Active Router for a Virtual Router, it
            is responsible for sending Router Advertisements for the Virtual
            Router as specified in <xref target="sect-6.4.3"/>.  The Backup Routers must be
            configured to send the same Router Advertisement options as the
            address owner.
          </t>
          <t>
            Router Advertisement options that advertise special services, e.g.,
            Home Agent Information Option, that are present in the address owner
            should not be sent by the address owner unless the Backup Routers are
            prepared to assume these services in full and have a complete and
            synchronized database for this service.

          <t>
            A VRRP Router acting as either an IPv6 Active Router or Backup Router, SHOULD
            accept Unsolicited Neighbor Advertisements and update the corresponding
            neighbor cache <xref target="RFC4861"/>. Since these are sent to the
            IPv6 all-nodes multicast address (FF02::1) <xref target="RFC4861"/> or the
            IPv6 all-routers multicast address (FF02::2), they will be received. Unsolicited
            Neighbor Advertisements are sent both in the case where the link-level addresses
            change <xref target="RFC4861"/> and for gratuitous neighbor discovery by first hop
            routers <xref target="RFC9131"/>. Additional configuration MAY be required in order
            for Unsolicited Neighbor Advertisements to update the corresponding neighbor cache.

          <name>Potential Forwarding Loop</name>
          <t>
            If it is not the address owner, a VRRP Router SHOULD NOT forward
            packets addressed to the IPvX address for which it becomes Active Router.
            Forwarding these packets would result in unnecessary traffic.  Also,
            in the case of LANs that receive packets they transmit, this can result
            in a forwarding loop that is only terminated when the IPvX TTL expires.
          </t>
          <t>
            One mechanism for VRRP Routers to these forwarding loops is to add/delete
            a host reject route for each non-owned IPvX address when transitioning
            to/from Active state.

          <name>Recommendations Regarding Setting Priority Values</name>
          <t>
            A priority value of 255 designates a particular router as the "IPvX address owner"
            for the VRID. VRRP Routers with priority 255 will, as soon as they start up, preempt all
            lower-priority routers.  For a VRID, only a single VRRP Router on the link SHOULD be
            configured with priority 255. If multiple VRRP Routers advertising priority 255 are
            detected, the condition SHOULD be logged (subject to rate-limiting). If no VRRP Router
            has this priority, and preemption is disabled, then no preemption will occur.
          </t>
          <t>
            In order to avoid two or more Backup Routers simultaneously becoming Active Routers after
            the previous Active Router fails or is shut down, all Virtual Routers SHOULD be configured
            with different priorities, and with sufficient differences in priority so that lower
            priority Backup Routers do not transition to Active state before receiving an advertisement
            from the highest priority Backup Router following it transitioning to Active Router.
          </t>
          <t>
            Since the Skew_Time is is inversely proportional to the priority, faster
            convergence can be obtained by using a higher priority for the preferred
            Backup Router. However, with multiple Backup Routers, the priorities should have
            sufficient differences as previously recommended.

            An implementation MAY implement a configuration flag that tells it to

          <t>
            When a Virtual Router is configured this way and is the Active Router, it

          <t>
            When a Virtual Router is configured this way and is the Backup Router, it
            should time out based on the rate advertised by the Active Router. In the
            case of a VRRPv2 Active Router, this means it must translate the timeout
            value it receives (in seconds) into centiseconds.  Also, a Backup
            Router should ignore VRRPv2 advertisements from the current Active Router
            if it is also receiving VRRPv3 packets from it.  It MAY report when a VRRPv3
            Active Router is not sending VRRPv2 packets as this suggests they don't
            agree on whether they're supporting VRRPv2 interoperation.

                It seems possible that a VRRPv3 Active Router sending at centisecond

                In this upgrade case, a deployment should initially run the VRRPv3
                Active Routers with lower frequencies, e.g., 100 centiseconds, until
                the VRRPv2 routers are upgraded.  Then, once the deployment has
                verified that VRRPv3 is working properly, the VRRPv2 support
                may be disabled and the desired sub-second rates may be configured.

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>
        VRRP for IPvX does not currently include any type of authentication.
        Earlier versions of the VRRP specification included
        several types of authentication ranging from no authentication to strong
        authentication.
        Operational experience and further analysis determined that these did
        not provide sufficient security to overcome the vulnerability of
        misconfigured secrets, causing multiple Active Routers to be elected.
        Due to the nature of the VRRP protocol, even if VRRP messages are
        cryptographically protected, it does not prevent hostile nodes from
        behaving as if they are an Active Router, creating multiple
        Active Routers.  Authentication of VRRP messages could have prevented
        a hostile node from causing all properly functioning routers from going
        into Backup state.  However, having multiple Active Routers can cause
        as much disruption as no routers, which authentication cannot prevent.
        Also, even if a hostile node could not disrupt VRRP, it can disrupt ARP
        and create the same effect as having all routers go into Backup state.
      </t>
      <t>
        Some L2 switches provide the capability to filter out, for example,
        ARP and/or ND messages from end-hosts on a switch-port basis.  This
        mechanism could also filter VRRP messages from switch ports
        associated with end-hosts and can be considered for deployments with
        untrusted hosts.
      </t>
      <t>
        It should be noted that these attacks are not worse and are a subset
        of the attacks that any node attached to a LAN can do independently
        of VRRP.  The kind of attacks a malicious node on a LAN can perform
        include:
      </t>
      <ul spacing="normal">
        <li>
          Promiscuously receiving packets for any router's MAC address.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sending packets with the router's MAC address as the source MAC
          address in the L2 header to tell the L2 switches to send packets
          addressed to the router to the malicious node instead of the router.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sending redirects to tell hosts to send their traffic
          somewhere else.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sending unsolicited ND replies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Answering ND requests, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <t>
        All of these can be done independently of implementing VRRP.
        VRRP does not add to these vulnerabilities.
      </t>
      <t>
        VRRP includes a mechanism
        (setting TTL = 255, checking on receipt) that protects against VRRP
        packets being injected from another remote network.  This limits most
        vulnerabilities to attacks on the local network.
      </t>
      <t>
        VRRP does not provide any confidentiality.  Confidentiality is not
        necessary for the correct operation of VRRP, and there is no
        information in the VRRP messages that must be kept secret from other
        nodes on the LAN.
      </t>
      <t>
        In the context of IPv6 operation, if SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)
        is deployed, VRRP is compatible with the "trust anchor" and "trust
        anchor or CGA" modes of SEND <xref target="RFC3971"/>.  The SEND
        configuration needs to give the Active and Backup Routers the same prefix
        delegation in the certificates so that Active and Backup Routers advertise
        the same set of subnet prefixes.  However, the Active and Backup Routers
        should have their own key pairs to avoid private key sharing.
