        This document defines the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) for
        IPv4 and IPv6.  It is version three (3) of the protocol, and it is
        based on VRRP (version 2) for IPv4 that is defined in RFC 3768 and in
        "Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol for IPv6".  VRRP specifies an
        election protocol that dynamically assigns responsibility for a
        virtual router to one of the VRRP routers on a LAN.  The VRRP router
        controlling the IPv4 or IPv6 address(es) associated with a virtual
        router is called the Active router, and it forwards packets sent to these
        IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  VRRP Active routers are configured with
        virtual IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, and VRRP Backup routers infer the
        address family of the virtual addresses being carried based on the
        transport protocol.  Within a VRRP router, the virtual routers in
        each of the IPv4 and IPv6 address families are a domain unto
        themselves and do not overlap.  The election process provides dynamic
        failover in the forwarding responsibility should the Active become
        unavailable.  For IPv4, the advantage gained from using VRRP is a
        higher-availability default path without requiring configuration of
        dynamic routing or router discovery protocols on every end-host.  For
        IPv6, the advantage gained from using VRRP for IPv6 is a quicker
        switchover to Backup routers than can be obtained with standard IPv6
        Neighbor Discovery mechanisms.

        VRRP provides a function similar to the proprietary protocols "Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP)"

      <name>A Note on Terminology</name>
      <t>
	This document discusses both IPv4 and IPv6 operations, and with
        respect to the VRRP protocol, many of the descriptions and procedures
        are common.  In this document, it would be less verbose to be able to
        refer to "IP" to mean either "IPv4 or IPv6".  However, historically,
        the term "IP" usually refers to IPv4.  For this reason, in this
        specification, the term "IPvX" (where X is 4 or 6) is introduced to
        mean either "IPv4" or "IPv6".  In this text, where the IP version
        matters, the appropriate term is used and the use of the term "IP" is
        avoided.
      </t>
      <t>
        The terms "Active" and "Backup" are concise terms for "Active VRRP Router"
        and "Backup VRRP Router".
      </t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="sect-1.2">
      <name>IPv4</name>
      <t>
	There are a number of methods that an IPv4 end-host can use to
        determine its first-hop router towards a particular IPv4 destination.
        These include running (or snooping) a dynamic routing protocol such
        as Routing Information Protocol <xref target="RFC2453"/> or OSPF version 2
	<xref target="RFC2328"/>, running an ICMP router discovery client <xref target="RFC1256"/>, or
      using a statically configured default route.</t>
      <t>
	Running a dynamic routing protocol on every end-host may be
        infeasible for a number of reasons, including administrative
        overhead, processing overhead, security issues, or lack of a protocol
        implementation for some platforms.  Neighbor or router discovery
        protocols may require active participation by all hosts on a network,
        leading to large timer values to reduce protocol overhead in the face
        of large numbers of hosts.  This can result in a significant delay in
        the detection of a lost (i.e., dead) neighbor; such a delay may
      introduce unacceptably long "black hole" periods.</t>
      <t>
	The use of a statically configured default route is quite popular; it
        minimizes configuration and processing overhead on the end-host and
        is supported by virtually every IPv4 implementation.  This mode of
        operation is likely to persist as dynamic host configuration
        protocols <xref target="RFC2131"/> are deployed, which typically provide
        configuration for an end-host IPv4 address and default gateway.
        However, this creates a single point of failure.  Loss of the default
        router results in a catastrophic event, isolating all end-hosts that
      are unable to detect any alternate path that may be available.</t>
      <t>
	The Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) is designed to
        eliminate the single point of failure inherent in the static default-
        routed environment.  VRRP specifies an election protocol that
        dynamically assigns responsibility for a virtual router to one of the
        VRRP routers on a LAN.  The VRRP router controlling the IPv4
        address(es) associated with a virtual router is called the Active and
        forwards packets sent to these IPv4 addresses.  The election process
        provides dynamic failover in the forwarding responsibility should the
        Active become unavailable.  Any of the virtual router's IPv4
      addresses on a LAN can then be used as the default first hop</t>
      <t>
	router by end-hosts.  The advantage gained from using VRRP is a
        higher availability default path without requiring configuration of
      dynamic routing or router discovery protocols on every end-host.</t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="sect-1.3">
      <name>IPv6</name>
      <t>
	IPv6 hosts on a LAN will usually learn about one or more default
        routers by receiving Router Advertisements sent using the IPv6
        Neighbor Discovery (ND) protocol <xref target="RFC4861"/>.  The Router
        Advertisements are multicast periodically at a rate that the hosts
        will learn about the default routers in a few minutes.  They are not
        sent frequently enough to rely on the absence of the Router
      Advertisement to detect router failures.</t>
      <t>
	Neighbor Discovery (ND) includes a mechanism called Neighbor
        Unreachability Detection to detect the failure of a neighbor node
        (router or host) or the forwarding path to a neighbor.  This is done
        by sending unicast ND Neighbor Solicitation messages to the neighbor
        node.  To reduce the overhead of sending Neighbor Solicitations, they
        are only sent to neighbors to which the node is actively sending
        traffic and only after there has been no positive indication that the
        router is up for a period of time.  Using the default parameters in
        ND, it will take a host about 38 seconds to learn that a router is
        unreachable before it will switch to another default router.  This
        delay would be very noticeable to users and cause some transport
      protocol implementations to time out.</t>
      <t>
	While the ND unreachability detection could be made quicker by
        changing the parameters to be more aggressive (note that the current
        lower limit for this is 5 seconds), this would have the downside of
        significantly increasing the overhead of ND traffic, especially when
        there are many hosts all trying to determine the reachability of one
      of more routers.</t>
      <t>
	The Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol for IPv6 provides a much
        faster switchover to an alternate default router than can be obtained
        using standard ND procedures.  Using VRRP, a Backup router can take
        over for a failed default router in around three seconds (using VRRP
        default parameters).  This is done without any interaction with the
      hosts and a minimum amount of VRRP traffic.</t>

	<t>
	  Backup of an IPvX address or addresses is the active function of
          VRRP.  While providing election of a Virtual Router Active and the
          additional functionality described below, the protocol should
        strive to:</t>

      </section>
      <section anchor="sect-2.2">
	<name>Preferred Path Indication</name>
	<t>
	  A simple model of Active election among a set of redundant routers is
          to treat each router with equal preference and claim victory after
          converging to any router as Active.  However, there are likely to be
          many environments where there is a distinct preference (or range of
          preferences) among the set of redundant routers.  For example, this
          preference may be based upon access link cost or speed, router
          performance or reliability, or other policy considerations.  The
          protocol should allow the expression of this relative path preference
          in an intuitive manner and guarantee Active convergence to the most
        preferential router currently available.</t>
      </section>
      <section anchor="sect-2.3">
	<name>Minimization of Unnecessary Service Disruptions</name>
	<t>
	  Once Active election has been performed, any unnecessary transitions
          between Active and Backup routers can result in a disruption in
          service.  The protocol should ensure after Active election that no
          state transition is triggered by any Backup router of equal or lower
        preference as long as the Active continues to function properly.</t>
	<t>
	  Some environments may find it beneficial to avoid the state
          transition triggered when a router that is preferred over the current
          Active becomes available.  It may be useful to support an override of
        the immediate convergence to the preferred path.</t>

      <section anchor="sect-2.4">
	<name>Efficient Operation over Extended LANs</name>
	<t>
	  Sending IPvX packets (that is, sending either IPv4 or IPv6) on a
          multiaccess LAN requires mapping from an IPvX address to a MAC
          address.  The use of the virtual router MAC address in an extended
          LAN employing learning bridges can have a significant effect on the
          bandwidth overhead of packets sent to the virtual router.  If the
          virtual router MAC address is never used as the source address in a
          link-level frame, then the station location is never learned,
          resulting in flooding of all packets sent to the virtual router.  To
          improve the efficiency in this environment, the protocol should:
          1) use the virtual router MAC address as the source in a packet sent
          by the Active to trigger station learning; 2) trigger a message
          immediately after transitioning to the Active to update the station
          learning; and 3) trigger periodic messages from the Active to
        maintain the station learning cache.</t>

      <section anchor="sect-2.5">
	<name>Sub-Second Operation for IPv4 and IPv6</name>
	<t>
	  Sub-second detection of Active VRRP router failure is needed in both
          IPv4 and IPv6 environments.  Earlier work proposed that sub-second
          operation was for IPv6; this specification leverages that earlier
        approach for IPv4 and IPv6.</t>
	<t>
	  One possible problematic scenario when using small
          VRRP_Advertisement_Intervals may occur when a router is delivering
          more packets onto the LAN than can be accommodated, and so a queue
          builds up in the router.  It is possible that packets being
          transmitted onto the VRRP-protected LAN could see larger queueing
          delay than the smallest VRRP Advertisement_Interval.  In this case,
          the Active_Down_Interval will be small enough so that normal queuing
          delays might cause a VRRP Backup to conclude that the Active is down,
          and therefore promote itself to Active.  Very shortly afterwards, the
          delayed VRRP packets from the Active cause a switch back to Backup
          status.  Furthermore, this process can repeat many times per second,
          causing significant disruption to traffic.  To mitigate this problem,
          priority forwarding of VRRP packets should be considered.  It should
          be possible for a VRRP Active to observe that this situation is
        occurring frequently and at least log the problem.</t>

      <name>VRRP Overview</name>
      <t>
	VRRP specifies an election protocol to provide the virtual router
        function described earlier.  All protocol messaging is performed
        using either IPv4 or IPv6 multicast datagrams; thus, the protocol can
        operate over a variety of multiaccess LAN technologies supporting
        IPvX multicast.  Each link of a VRRP virtual router has a single
        well-known MAC address allocated to it.  This document currently only
        details the mapping to networks using the IEEE 802 48-bit MAC
        address.  The virtual router MAC address is used as the source in all
        periodic VRRP messages sent by the Active router to enable bridge
      learning in an extended LAN.</t>
      <t>
	A virtual router is defined by its virtual router identifier (VRID)
        and a set of either IPv4 or IPv6 address(es).  A VRRP router may
        associate a virtual router with its real address on an interface.
        The scope of each virtual router is restricted to a single LAN.  A
        VRRP router may be configured with additional virtual router mappings
        and priority for virtual routers it is willing to back up.  The
        mapping between the VRID and its IPvX address(es) must be coordinated
      among all VRRP routers on a LAN.</t>
      <t>
	There is no restriction against reusing a VRID with a different
        address mapping on different LANs, nor is there a restriction against
        using the same VRID number for a set of IPv4 addresses and a set of
      IPv6 addresses; however, these are two different virtual routers.</t>
      <t>
	To minimize network traffic, only the Active for each virtual router
        sends periodic VRRP Advertisement messages.  A Backup router will not
        attempt to preempt the Active unless it has higher priority.  This
        eliminates service disruption unless a more preferred path becomes
        available.  It's also possible to administratively prohibit all
        preemption attempts.  The only exception is that a VRRP router will
        always become Active of any virtual router associated with addresses
        it owns.  If the Active becomes unavailable, then the highest-
        priority Backup will transition to Active after a short delay,
        providing a controlled transition of the virtual router
      responsibility with minimal service interruption.</t>
      <t>
	The VRRP protocol design provides rapid transition from Backup to
        Active to minimize service interruption and incorporates
        optimizations that reduce protocol complexity while guaranteeing
        controlled Active transition for typical operational scenarios.  The
        optimizations result in an election protocol with minimal runtime
        state requirements, minimal active protocol states, and a single
        message type and sender.  The typical operational scenarios are
        defined to be two redundant routers and/or distinct path preferences
        among each router.  A side effect when these assumptions are violated
        (i.e., more than two redundant paths, all with equal preference) is
        that duplicate packets may be forwarded for a brief period during
        Active election.  However, the typical scenario assumptions are
        likely to cover the vast majority of deployments, loss of the Active
        router is infrequent, and the expected duration in Active election
      convergence is quite small ( &lt;&lt; 1 second ).  Thus, the VRRP optimizations represent significant simplifications in the protocol design while incurring an insignificant probability of brief network degradation.</t>

	<t>
	  In the IPv4 case (that is, IPvX is IPv4 everywhere in the figure),
          each router is permanently assigned an IPv4 address on the LAN
          interface (Rtr1 is assigned IPv4 A and Rtr2 is assigned IPv4 B), and
          each host installs a static default route through one of the routers
        (in this example they all use Rtr1's IPv4 A).</t>
	<t>
	  In the IPv6 case (that is, IPvX is IPv6 everywhere in the figure),
          each router has a link-local IPv6 address on the LAN interface (Rtr1
          is assigned IPv6 Link-Local A and Rtr2 is assigned IPv6 Link-
          Local B), and each host learns a default route from Router
          Advertisements through one of the routers (in this example, they all
        use Rtr1's IPv6 Link-Local A).</t>
	<t>
	  Moving to an IPv4 VRRP environment, each router has the exact same
          permanently assigned IPv4 address.  Rtr1 is said to be the IPv4
          address owner of IPv4 A, and Rtr2 is the IPv4 address owner of
          IPv4 B.  A virtual router is then defined by associating a unique
          identifier (the virtual router ID) with the address owned by a
        router.</t>
	<t>
	  Moving to an IPv6 VRRP environment, each router has the exact same
          Link-Local IPv6 address.  Rtr1 is said to be the IPv6 address owner
          of IPv6 A, and Rtr2 is the IPv6 address owner of IPv6 B.  A virtual
          router is then defined by associating a unique identifier (the
        virtual router ID) with the address owned by a router.</t>
	<t>
	  Finally, in both the IPv4 and IPv6 cases, the VRRP protocol manages
        virtual router failover to a Backup router.</t>
	<t>
	  The IPv4 example above shows a virtual router configured to cover the
          IPv4 address owned by Rtr1 (VRID=1, IPv4_Address=A).  When VRRP is
          enabled on Rtr1 for VRID=1, it will assert itself as Active, with
          priority = 255, since it is the IP address owner for the virtual
          router IP address.  When VRRP is enabled on Rtr2 for VRID=1, it will
          transition to Backup, with priority = 100 (the default priority is
          100), since it is not the IPv4 address owner.  If Rtr1 should fail,
          then the VRRP protocol will transition Rtr2 to Active, temporarily
          taking over forwarding responsibility for IPv4 A to provide
          uninterrupted service to the hosts.  When Rtr1 returns to service, it
        will re-assert itself as Active.</t>
	<t>
	  The IPv6 example above shows a virtual router configured to cover the
          IPv6 address owned by Rtr1 (VRID=1, IPv6_Address=A).  When VRRP is
          enabled on Rtr1 for VRID=1, it will assert itself as Active, with
          priority = 255, since it is the IPv6 address owner for the virtual
          router IPv6 address.  When VRRP is enabled on Rtr2 for VRID=1, it
          will transition to Backup, with priority = 100 (the default priority
          is 100), since it is not the IPv6 address owner.  If Rtr1 should
          fail, then the VRRP protocol will transition Rtr2 to Active,
          temporarily taking over forwarding responsibility for IPv6 A to
        provide uninterrupted service to the hosts.</t>
	<t>
	  Note that in both cases, in this example IPvX B is not backed up; it
          is only used by Rtr2 as its interface address.  In order to back up
          IPvX B, a second virtual router must be configured.  This is shown in
        the next section.</t>

	  In the IPv4 example above (that is, IPvX is IPv4 everywhere in the

          Rtr1's IPv4 A, and half are using Rtr2's IPv4 B.  The configuration
          of virtual router VRID=1 is exactly the same as in the first example
          (see <xref target="sect-4.1"/>), and a second virtual router has been added to
          cover the IPv4 address owned by Rtr2 (VRID=2, IPv4_Address=B).  In
          this case, Rtr2 will assert itself as Active for VRID=2 while Rtr1
          will act as a Backup.  This scenario demonstrates a deployment
          providing load splitting when both routers are available, while
        providing full redundancy for robustness.</t>

	  In the IPv6 example above (that is, IPvX is IPv6 everywhere in the

  This VRRP specification describes how to advertise and resolve the

<name>ICMP Redirects</name>
<t>
  ICMP redirects may be used normally when VRRP is running between a
  group of routers.  This allows VRRP to be used in environments where
the topology is not symmetric.</t>
<t>
  The IPv4 source address of an ICMP redirect should be the address
  that the end-host used when making its next-hop routing decision.  If
  a VRRP router is acting as Active for virtual router(s) containing
  addresses it does not own, then it must determine which virtual
  router the packet was sent to when selecting the redirect source
  address.  One method to deduce the virtual router used is to examine
  the destination MAC address in the packet that triggered the
redirect.</t>
<t>
  It may be useful to disable redirects for specific cases where VRRP
  is being used to load-share traffic between a number of routers in a
symmetric topology.</t>
</section>
<section anchor="sect-8.1.2">
<name>Host ARP Requests</name>
<t>
  When a host sends an ARP request for one of the virtual router IPv4
  addresses, the Virtual Router Active MUST respond to the ARP request
  with an ARP response that indicates the virtual MAC address for the
  virtual router.  Note that the source address of the Ethernet frame
  of this ARP response is the physical MAC address of the physical
  router.  The Virtual Router Active MUST NOT respond with its physical
  MAC address in the ARP response.  This allows the client to always
use the same MAC address regardless of the current Active router.</t>
<t>
  When a VRRP router restarts or boots, it SHOULD NOT send any ARP
  messages using its physical MAC address for the IPv4 address it owns;
it should only send ARP messages that include virtual MAC addresses.</t>
<t>
This may entail the following:</t>
<ul spacing="normal">
  <li>When configuring an interface, Virtual Router Active routers
  should broadcast a gratuitous ARP request containing the virtual
router MAC address for each IPv4 address on that interface.</li>
<li>At system boot, when initializing interfaces for VRRP operation,
delay gratuitous ARP requests and ARP responses until both the
IPv4 address and the virtual router MAC address are configured.</li>
<li>When, for example, ssh access to a particular VRRP router is
required, an IP address known to belong to that router must be
used.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section anchor="sect-8.1.3">
<name>Proxy ARP</name>
<t>
  If Proxy ARP is to be used on a VRRP router, then the VRRP router
  must advertise the virtual router MAC address in the Proxy ARP
  message.  Doing otherwise could cause hosts to learn the real MAC
address of the VRRP router.</t>
</section>
</section>
<section anchor="sect-8.2">
<name>IPv6</name>
<section anchor="sect-8.2.1">
<name>ICMPv6 Redirects</name>
<t>
  ICMPv6 redirects may be used normally when VRRP is running between a
  group of routers <xref target="RFC4443"/>.  This allows VRRP to be used in
  environments where the topology is not symmetric (e.g., the VRRP
routers do not connect to the same destinations).</t>
<t>
  The IPv6 source address of an ICMPv6 redirect should be the address
  that the end-host used when making its next-hop routing decision.  If
  a VRRP router is acting as Active for virtual router(s) containing
  addresses it does not own, then it must determine which virtual
  router the packet was sent to when selecting the redirect source
  address.  A method to deduce the virtual router used is to examine
  the destination MAC address in the packet that triggered the
redirect.</t>
</section>
<section anchor="sect-8.2.2">
<name>ND Neighbor Solicitation</name>
<t>
  When a host sends an ND Neighbor Solicitation message for the virtual
  router IPv6 address, the Virtual Router Active MUST respond to the ND
  Neighbor Solicitation message with the virtual MAC address for the
  virtual router.  The Virtual Router Active MUST NOT respond with its
  physical MAC address.  This allows the client to always use the same
MAC address regardless of the current Active router.</t>
<t>
  When a Virtual Router Active sends an ND Neighbor Solicitation
  message for a host's IPv6 address, the Virtual Router Active MUST
  include the virtual MAC address for the virtual router if it sends a
  source link-layer address option in the neighbor solicitation
  message.  It MUST NOT use its physical MAC address in the source
link-layer address option.</t>
<t>
  When a VRRP router restarts or boots, it SHOULD NOT send any ND
  messages with its physical MAC address for the IPv6 address it owns;
it should only send ND messages that include virtual MAC addresses.</t>
<t>
This may entail the following:</t>
<ul spacing="normal">
  <li>When configuring an interface, Virtual Router Active routers
  should send an unsolicited ND Neighbor Advertisement message
  containing the virtual router MAC address for the IPv6 address on
that interface.</li>
<li>At system boot, when initializing interfaces for VRRP operation,
all ND Router and Neighbor Advertisements and Solicitation
messages must be delayed until both the IPv6 address and the
virtual router MAC address are configured.</li>
</ul>
<t>
  Note that on a restarting Active router where the VRRP protected
  address is the interface address, (that is, priority 255) duplicate
  address detection (DAD) may fail, as the Backup router may answer
  that it owns the address.  One solution is to not run DAD in this
case.</t>
</section>
<section anchor="sect-8.2.3">
<name>Router Advertisements</name>
<t>
  When a Backup VRRP router has become Active for a virtual router, it
  is responsible for sending Router Advertisements for the virtual
  router as specified in <xref target="sect-6.4.3"/>.  The Backup routers must be
  configured to send the same Router Advertisement options as the
address owner.</t>
<t>
  Router Advertisement options that advertise special services (e.g.,
  Home Agent Information Option) that are present in the address owner
  should not be sent by the address owner unless the Backup routers are
  prepared to assume these services in full and have a complete and
synchronized database for this service.</t>
</section>
</section>
<section anchor="sect-8.3">
<name>IPvX</name>
<section anchor="sect-8.3.1">
<name>Potential Forwarding Loop</name>
<t>
  If it is not the address owner, a VRRP router SHOULD NOT forward
  packets addressed to the IPvX address for which it becomes Active.
  Forwarding these packets would result in unnecessary traffic.  Also,
  in the case of LANs that receive packets they transmit (e.g., Token
  Ring), this can result in a forwarding loop that is only terminated
when the IPvX TTL expires.</t>
<t>
  One such mechanism for VRRP routers is to add/delete a reject host
  route for each adopted IPvX address when transitioning to/from Active
state.</t>
</section>
<section anchor="sect-8.3.2">
<name>Recommendations Regarding Setting Priority Values</name>
<t>
  A priority value of 255 designates a particular router as the "IPvX address owner".  Care must be taken not to configure more than one
router on the link in this way for a single VRID.</t>
<t>
  Routers with priority 255 will, as soon as they start up, preempt all
  lower-priority routers.  No more than one router on the link is to be
  configured with priority 255, especially if preemption is set.  If no
  router has this priority, and preemption is disabled, then no
preemption will occur.</t>
<t>
  When there are multiple Backup routers, their priority values should
  be uniformly distributed.  For example, if one Backup router has the
  default priority of 100 and another Backup Router is added, a
  priority of 50 would be a better choice for it than 99 or 100, in
order to facilitate faster convergence.</t>

<name>VRRPv3 Support of VRRPv2</name>
<t>
  As mentioned above, this support is intended for upgrade scenarios
and is NOT recommended for permanent deployments.</t>
<t>
  An implementation MAY implement a configuration flag that tells it to
listen for and send both VRRPv2 and VRRPv3 advertisements.</t>
<t>
  When a virtual router is configured this way and is the Active, it
MUST send both types at the configured rate, even if sub-second.</t>
<t>
  When a virtual router is configured this way and is the Backup, it
  should time out based on the rate advertised by the Active; in the
  case of a VRRPv2 Active, this means it must translate the timeout
  value it receives (in seconds) into centiseconds.  Also, a Backup
  should ignore VRRPv2 advertisements from the current Active if it is
  also receiving VRRPv3 packets from it.  It MAY report when a VRRPv3
  Active is *not* sending VRRPv2 packets: that suggests they don't
agree on whether they're supporting VRRPv2 routers.</t>

    <t>
      The VRRPv2 Active router interacting with a sub-second VRRPv3 Backup
    router is the most important example of this.</t>
    <t>
      A VRRPv2 implementation should not be given a higher priority than a
      VRRPv2/VRRPv3 implementation it is interacting with if the VRRPv2/
    VRRPv3 rate is sub-second.</t>
  </section>
  <section anchor="sect-8.4.3.2">
    <name>Overwhelming VRRPv2 Backups</name>
    <t>
      It seems possible that a VRRPv3 Active router sending at centisecond
      rates could potentially overwhelm a VRRPv2 Backup router with
    potentially unclear results.</t>
    <t>
      In this upgrade case, a deployment should initially run the VRRPv3
      Active routers with lower frequencies (e.g., 100 centiseconds) until
      the VRRPv2 routers are upgraded.  Then, once the deployment has
      convinced itself that VRRPv3 is working properly, the VRRPv2 support
    may be unconfigured and then the desired sub-second rates configured.</t>

    IANA has assigned an IPv6 link-local scope multicast address for VRRP
    for IPv6.  The IPv6 multicast address is FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:12.

<section anchor="Security" numbered="true" toc="default">
  <name>Security Considerations</name>
  <t>
    VRRP for IPvX does not currently include any type of authentication.
    Earlier versions of the VRRP (for IPv4) specification included
  </t>
  <t>
    Some L2 switches provide the capability to filter out, for example,
    ARP and/or ND messages from end-hosts on a switch-port basis.  This
    mechanism could also filter VRRP messages from switch ports
    associated with end-hosts and can be considered for deployments with
    untrusted hosts.
  </t>
  <t>
    It should be noted that these attacks are not worse and are a subset
    of the attacks that any node attached to a LAN can do independently
    of VRRP.  The kind of attacks a malicious node on a LAN can do
    include promiscuously receiving packets for any router's MAC address;
    sending packets with the router's MAC address as the source MAC
    address in the L2 header to tell the L2 switches to send packets
    addressed to the router to the malicious node instead of the router;
    send redirects to tell the hosts to send their traffic somewhere
    else; send unsolicited ND replies; answer ND requests; etc.  All of
    this can be done independently of implementing VRRP.  VRRP does not
    add to these vulnerabilities.
  </t>
  <t>
    Independent of any authentication type, VRRP includes a mechanism
    (setting TTL = 255, checking on receipt) that protects against VRRP
    packets being injected from another remote network.  This limits most
    vulnerabilities to local attacks.
  </t>
  <t>
    VRRP does not provide any confidentiality.  Confidentiality is not
    necessary for the correct operation of VRRP, and there is no
    information in the VRRP messages that must be kept secret from other
    nodes on the LAN.
  </t>
  <t>
    In the context of IPv6 operation, if SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)
    is deployed, VRRP is compatible with the "trust anchor" and "trust
    anchor or cga" modes of SEND <xref target="RFC3971"/>.  The SEND configuration needs
    to give the Active and Backup routers the same prefix delegation in
    the certificates so that Active and Backup routers advertise the same
    set of subnet prefixes.  However, the Active and Backup routers
    should have their own key pairs to avoid private key sharing.

	<title>Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) Version 3 for IPv4 and IPv6</title>

	<abstract>
	  <t>
	    This memo defines the Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) for
	    IPv4 and IPv6.  It is version three (3) of the protocol, and it is
	    based on VRRP (version 2) for IPv4 that is defined in RFC 3768 and in
	    "Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol for IPv6".  VRRP specifies an
	    election protocol that dynamically assigns responsibility for a
	    virtual router to one of the VRRP routers on a LAN.  The VRRP router
	    controlling the IPv4 or IPv6 address(es) associated with a virtual
	    router is called the Active router, and it forwards packets sent to these
	    IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  VRRP Active routers are configured with
	    virtual IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, and VRRP Backup routers infer the
	    address family of the virtual addresses being carried based on the
	    transport protocol.  Within a VRRP router, the virtual routers in
	    each of the IPv4 and IPv6 address families are a domain unto
	    themselves and do not overlap.  The election process provides dynamic
	    failover in the forwarding responsibility should the Active become
	    unavailable.  For IPv4, the advantage gained from using VRRP is a
	    higher-availability default path without requiring configuration of
	    dynamic routing or router discovery protocols on every end-host.  For
	    IPv6, the advantage gained from using VRRP for IPv6 is a quicker
	    switchover to Backup routers than can be obtained with standard IPv6
	    Neighbor Discovery mechanisms.</t>

  transitions, etc., VRRP may cause there to be more than one Active
  router.  If a Active router installs the virtual router MAC address
  as the hardware address on a FDDI device, then other Actives'
  ADVERTISEMENTS will be removed from the ring during the Active
convergence, and convergence will fail.</t>
<t>
  To avoid this, an implementation SHOULD configure the virtual router
  MAC address by adding a unicast MAC filter in the FDDI device, rather
  than changing its hardware MAC address.  This will prevent a Active
router from removing any ADVERTISEMENTS it did not originate.</t>

  <name>Operation over Token Ring</name>
  <t>
    Token Ring has several characteristics that make running VRRP
  difficult.  These include the following:</t>
  <ul spacing="normal">
    <li>In order to switch to a new Active located on a different bridge
    Token-Ring segment from the previous Active when using source-
    route bridges, a mechanism is required to update cached source-
    route information.</li>
    <li>No general multicast mechanism is supported across old and new
    Token-Ring adapter implementations.  While many newer Token-Ring
    adapters support group addresses, Token-Ring functional-address
    support is the only generally available multicast mechanism.  Due
    to the limited number of Token-Ring functional addresses, these
    may collide with other usage of the same Token-Ring functional
    addresses.</li>
  </ul>
  <t>
    Due to these difficulties, the preferred mode of operation over Token
    Ring will be to use a Token-Ring functional address for the VRID
    virtual MAC address.  Token-Ring functional addresses have the two
    high-order bits in the first MAC address octet set to B'1'.  They
    range from 03-00-00-00-00-80 to 03-00-02-00-00-00 (canonical format).
    However, unlike multicast addresses, there is only one unique
    functional address per bit position.  The functional addresses
    03-00-00-10-00-00 through 03-00-02-00-00-00 are reserved by the
    Token-Ring Architecture <xref target="TKARCH"/> for user-defined applications.
    However, since there are only 12 user-defined Token-Ring functional
    addresses, there may be other non-IPvX protocols using the same
    functional address.  Since the Novell IPX <xref target="IPX"/> protocol uses the
    03-00-00-10-00-00 functional address, operation of VRRP over Token
    Ring will avoid use of this functional address.  In general, Token-
    Ring VRRP users will be responsible for resolution of other user-
  defined Token-Ring functional address conflicts.</t>
  <t>
    VRIDs are mapped directly to Token-Ring functional addresses.  In
    order to decrease the likelihood of functional-address conflicts,
    allocation will begin with the largest functional address.  Most non-
    IPvX protocols use the first or first couple user-defined functional
    addresses, and it is expected that VRRP users will choose VRIDs
  sequentially, starting with 1.</t>

  <t>
    Or, more succinctly, octets 3 and 4 of the functional address are
  equal to (0x4000 >> (VRID - 1)) in non-canonical format.</t>
  <t>
    Since a functional address cannot be used as a MAC-level source
    address, the real MAC address is used as the MAC source address in
    VRRP advertisements.  This is not a problem for bridges, since
    packets addressed to functional addresses will be sent on the
  spanning-tree explorer path <xref target="ISO.10038.1993"/>.</t>
  <t>
    The functional-address mode of operation MUST be implemented by
  routers supporting VRRP on Token Ring.</t>
  <t>
    Additionally, routers MAY support the unicast mode of operation to
    take advantage of newer Token-Ring adapter implementations that
    support non-promiscuous reception for multiple unicast MAC addresses
    and to avoid both the multicast traffic and usage conflicts
    associated with the use of Token-Ring functional addresses.  Unicast
    mode uses the same mapping of VRIDs to virtual MAC addresses as
    Ethernet.  However, one important difference exists.  ND
    request/reply packets contain the virtual MAC address as the source
    MAC address.  The reason for this is that some Token-Ring driver
    implementations keep a cache of MAC address/source-routing
  information independent of the ND cache.</t>
  <t>
    Hence, these implementations have to receive a packet with the
    virtual MAC address as the source address in order to transmit to
  that MAC address in a source-route-bridged network.</t>
  <t>
    Unicast mode on Token Ring has one limitation that should be
    considered.  If there are VRID routers on different source-route-
    bridge segments, and there are host implementations that keep their
    source-route information in the ND cache and do not listen to
    gratuitous NDs, these hosts will not update their ND source-route
    information correctly when a switchover occurs.  The only possible
    solution is to put all routers with the same VRID on the same source-
    route-bridge segment and use techniques to prevent that bridge
    segment from being a single point of failure.  These techniques are
  beyond the scope of this document.</t>
  <t>
    For both the multicast and unicast mode of operation, VRRP
    advertisements sent to 224.0.0.18 should be encapsulated as described
  in <xref target="RFC1469"/>.</t>
